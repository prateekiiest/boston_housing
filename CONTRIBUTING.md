Hey! It's good to see that you want to contribute to our project 'Boston_housing'

First things first. 

- How to fork the repository?
The first step is to fork the GitHub repository with which you’d like to work. Forking it is basically making a copy of the repository, but with a link back to the original.

Forking a repository is really straightforward:

> Make sure you’re logged into GitHub with your account.
> Find the GitHub repository at this link https://github.com/prateekiiest/boston_housing 
> Click the Fork button on the upper right-hand side of the repository’s page.
> That’s it—you now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

- How do you create and delete branches in Github?

When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas. Changes you make on a branch don't affect the master branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with.

Creating branches : 
> On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. 
> Click the branch selector menu.
> Type a unique name for your new branch.
> Press Enter.

Deleting a branch : 
> On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
> Above the list of files, click  NUMBER branches.
> Scroll to the branch that you want to delete, then click .

- How to send Pull requests?
Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the master branch only contains finished and approved work.
Pull requests can only be opened if there are differences between your branch and the upstream branch. You can specify which branch you'd like to merge your changes into when you create your pull request.

> On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
> In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.
> To the right of the Branch menu, click New pull request.
> Use the base branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the compare branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.
> Type a title and description for your pull request.
> Click Create pull request.
